// to  be  correctly  handled.   For example, changes to st_atime or st_mtime
// (respectively, time of last access and time of last modification; see inode(7))
// do not require flushing because they are not necessary for a subsequent data
// read to be handled correctly. On the other hand, a change to the file size
// (st_size, as made by say ftruncate(2)), would require a metadata flush.
//
// The aim of fdatasync() is to reduce disk activity for applications that
// do not require all metadata to be synchronized with the disk.
